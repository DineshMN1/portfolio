# Introduction to Blockchain
<span className="italic text-sm text-gray-500">March 17, 2025</span>  

<AnimatedName />

**Blockchain** is the technology behind digital currencies like **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum**, which together have a combined market value of **over $2.73 trillion** as of 2025.

But **blockchain** goes beyond cryptocurrency — it enables secure, transparent transactions without intermediaries, transforming how industries operate.

<h2 id="what-is-blockchain" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What is Blockchain?</h2>

Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple nodes in a secure and tamper-proof manner. It is the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

<h2 id="key-components-of-blockchain" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Key Components of Blockchain</h2>

- **Blocks:** Each block contains a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference (hash) to the previous block.  
- **Decentralization:** Instead of a central authority, the blockchain is maintained by a distributed network of nodes (computers).  
- **Immutability:** Once a block is added to the blockchain, altering any data would require changing all subsequent blocks, making it nearly impossible to tamper with.  
- **Consensus Mechanisms:** Transactions are validated through different methods like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), ensuring the integrity of the network.  
- **Public & Verifiable:** Each transaction on the blockchain can be **viewed** and **verified** by anyone. This transparency builds trust and removes the need for intermediaries.

<h2 id="the-building-blocks" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">The Building Blocks</h2>

Each block has three pieces of information in it:

<div className="border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-4 bg-white">
  <Image src={block} alt="block" />
</div>

- **Data** – The actual transaction details stored in the block.  
- **Previous block hash** – A unique code linking it to the previous block.  
- **A new ‘hash’ for the current block** – A unique code representing the block’s data.

<h2 id="a-chain-of-blocks" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">A Chain of Blocks</h2>

<div className="border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-4 bg-white">
  <Image src={blocks} alt="blocks" />
</div>

In the case of a blockchain like Bitcoin, this data contains information of the sender, recipient, and the amount of money transferred.

The ‘hash’ is essentially a long string of characters (numbers and alphabets).  
Each hash of a block is connected to the block before it.

It is because of this property that all blocks in the blockchain are connected to one another.

<h2 id="genesis-block" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Genesis Block</h2>

The **Genesis Block** is the very first block on the blockchain — the point where it all begins.

Since there are no blocks before it, it has **no previous hash**, making it unique by design.

<div className="border border-gray-200 rounded-md p-4 bg-white">
  <Image src={genesis} alt="genesis" />
</div>

Hardcoded into the network, it marks the **birth of the blockchain** and sets the initial state for all future blocks.

<h2 id="security" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Security</h2>

The strength of blockchain lies in its structure — if someone tries to tamper with the data in a block, the hash of that block changes.

Since each block is linked to the next using this hash, even a small change breaks the entire chain.

Every block's hash is tightly connected to the one that follows it. So, modifying one block affects all the blocks after it, making unauthorized changes easily detectable and practically impossible.

<h2 id="conclusion" className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Conclusion</h2>

In this blog post, we explored the foundational concepts of blockchain technology:

- The **basic structure** of a block and how blocks are linked  
- The **genesis block** as the starting point of every blockchain  
- The **security model** that makes blockchain tamper-resistant  
- The flow of **transactions** and how data is recorded  
- The role of **hashes** in maintaining the integrity of the chain  

Together, these topics build a clear picture of how blockchain works under the hood — providing a strong foundation for diving into more advanced concepts in the future.
